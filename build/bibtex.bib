	abstract = {Results of an acoustic study of voiceless fricatives in seven languages are presented. Three measurements were taken: duration, center of gravity, and overall spectral shape. In addition, formant transitions from adjacent vowels were measured for a subset of the fricatives in certain languages. Fricatives were well differentiated in terms of overall spectral shape and their coarticulation effects on formant transitions for adjacent vowels. The center of gravity measurement also proved useful in differentiating certain fricatives. Duration generally was less useful in differentiating the fricatives. In general, results were consistent across speakers and languages, with lateral fricatives displaying the greatest interspeaker variation in their acoustic properties and /s/ providing the greatest source of interspeaker variation.},

	abstract = {A well-established difference between male and female voices is the greater degree of breathy voice used by women. The acoustic measure that has most commonly been used to validate this difference is the amplitude of the ﬁrst two harmonics relative to each other, as well as in relation to other spectral parameters. This paper suggests that sex-speciﬁc differences in the harmonic expression of nasality combined with the high likelihood of nasality being present in the open vowels, which have often been used to minimise the effect of F1 on the lowest harmonics, make H1 and H2 inappropriate reference points to measure sex-speciﬁc differences in breathiness. The relative harmonic amplitude patterns are replicated using formant synthesis (SenSyn).},
